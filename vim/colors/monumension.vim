" Named after the great Monumension album from Enslaved which inspired the
" choice of colors (except for the yellow and orange parts, but those need
" distinctiveness)
"
" There are custom syntax groups, defined there:
" https://github.com/boucherm/dotvim/tree/master/.vim/after/syntax
"
" Background color of the term is supposed to be dark grey (#212121 or grey13)
"
" Some of urxvt 16 base colors were awful, I changed those in the .Xresources file:
